"Has a great story. I want to be able to play the story mode with my friends. I want good graphics. Open world, RPG game. I want the game to have fanthasy themes, like monsters swords and such.",5,"<h2>1. Depersonalization</h2>
<p>No, I don’t recommend this game for you. It has a great story, but the translation is poor and the graphics are not as good as you might want. It is a strategy RPG, not an open world RPG, and it does not have fantasy themes like monsters and swords.</p>
<h2>2. Detroit: Become Human</h2>
<p>No, Detroit: Become Human is not a good recommendation for you. It is a narrative-driven game with minimal game-play and no open world or RPG elements. It does have great graphics and a compelling story, but it does not have any fantasy themes or the ability to play with friends.</p>
<h2>3. For The King</h2>
<p>No, I don’t recommend this game for you. For the King is a strategy game with a unique art style and high replayability, but it does not have a great story and it is not an open world RPG game. It is focused on fighting and levelling rather than exploring, and it does not have fantasy themes like monsters, swords, and such.</p>
<h2>4. DRAGON QUEST® XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age™ - Definitive Edition</h2>
<p>Yes, I would recommend Dragon Quest XI to you. It has a great story and is an open world RPG game with fantasy themes like monsters, swords, and more. It also has great graphics and you can play the story mode with your friends.</p>
<h2>5. Horizon Zero Dawn™ Complete Edition</h2>
<p>Yes, Horizon Zero Dawn is a great game with a great story. It has beautiful graphics and is an open world RPG with fantasy themes like monsters, swords, and more. It is a single-player game, so you won’t be able to play the story mode with your friends, but you can still explore the world together. The game has a 9/10 rating and is definitely worth the price.</p>
<h2>6. Kingdom Come: Deliverance</h2>
<p>No, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is not the game for you. It is a realistic medieval RPG with no fantasy elements. It has a great story, but it is not an open world game and it does not have multiplayer. The graphics are good, but it is not a game for casual gamers.</p>
<h2>7. Wildermyth</h2>
<p>Yes, Wildermyth is a great game for you. It has a great story, and you can play the story mode with your friends in co-op up to 5 people. The graphics are good, and the game has a fantasy theme with monsters, swords, and other elements. It also has a procedurally generated narrative, so each playthrough feels unique.</p>
<h2>8. Mafia II (Classic)</h2>
<p>Yes, I would recommend Mafia 2 to you. It has a great story and the graphics are still good for a 2010 game. It is not an open world RPG game, but it does have some great gunfights, robberies, boss missions and car chases. The controls are very nicely done and the soundtrack is awesome. It is more like a movie than a video game and has a great mix of family life and gang life. However, it does not have any fantasy themes like monsters and swords.</p>
<h2>9. The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt</h2>
<p>Yes, I would highly recommend The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. It has an amazing story with memorable characters and a living and breathing open world. The graphics are superb and the attention to detail is incredible. It has a great fantasy theme with monsters, swords, and other elements. It also has a great co-op mode so you can play the story mode with your friends.</p>
<h2>10. TROUBLESHOOTER: Abandoned Children</h2>
<p>No, this game is not a good fit for your query. It is a tactical RPG with an anime-like story, and does not have open world or fantasy themes. It does have great characters and a deep character customization system, but the graphics are not particularly impressive. It is a single-player game, so you would not be able to play the story mode with your friends.</p>
