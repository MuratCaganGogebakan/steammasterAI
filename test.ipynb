The game revolves around defeating bosses to progress and unlock new content, but the player has high agency and can play and progress at their own pace. With over 4000 items in the game, every playthrough feels unique and not repetitive. It offers both a casual and challenging experience for players. The game is only 200mb but offers hundreds of hours worth of content. The game has some cons such as inventory management and a difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld, but overall it is an amazing experience from beginning to end. The game has great music, easy multiplayer setup, and runs well on most computers. Terraria is very inexpensive and worth every penny.'"
