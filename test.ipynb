       " Document(page_content=\"Assassin's Creed® Syndicate: [b]Pros:[/b] I love the Assassin's Creed series, this game is great too. Nice graphics. Nice story. OK optimization.  [b]Cons:[/b] Could be more optimized Water could look better.  Pirated Ubisoft games: You click it and game starts Bought Ubisoft games: You click it, Steam starts (It might update too), Uplay starts (It might update too), and finally the game starts. This bothers me a lot. If we bought it, EVERYTHING has to be better than a pirated version. [b]I AM IN NO WAY ENCOURAGING PIRACY[/b]Assassin's Creed has, until now, been something I appreciated more in concept than in execution. Syndicate is the first in the series I have actually, legitimately enjoyed in almost all regards. Part of this is due to a bit of personal bias - Victorian London has always been a favorite setting of mine and it's here in beautiful, meticulously detailed glory. But aside from that, the actual gameplay is improved, specifically with stealth and traversal. Botching a stealth kill doesn't automatically alert everyone and their mother within a 20 mile radius, and the zipline lets you avoid having to ponderously pick your way up every single building facade if you don't want to. Furthermore, each sidequest can be completed through a number of different methods, and there's not an overwhelming amount of stupid collectibles. And while the story itself is merely okay, the characters you meet and play as are all pretty charming and even legit funny. Syndcicate seems to be all about removing all the series' barriers between you and fun, and it's definitely working for me.\", metadata={}),\n",

I love the original format especially the ezio trilogy however if this is just treated as an anicent egyptian RPG with AC elements it is an amazing game on its own. Highly recommend you play this despite being different to the conventional AC games. You can also choose your build and can play as more of an assassin or a warrior.  Update: I have now played the DLC and attained 100% completion. Excellent DLC with lots of new extra content. Personally I preferred the shorter Hidden Ones DLC loved the new legendary outfit. Curse of the Pharohs is much longer with a lot of unique content and a more mythical feel and more challenging bosses than \", metadata={}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Deceive Inc.: Highly, HIGHLY recommend you give this game a shot! It's fun to be a sneaky spy, and to deduce that an NPC is a player based on their movements and actions. Great cast of playable agents with interesting and unique abilities, weapons, and gadgets.  also, make sure to turn off animated portraits so you can have a stable framerate.s a solid try. You will not be disappointed.I absolutely love this game! I played the beta and have been counting down the days until its release.  The game offers unique gameplay with short, fast paced matches. There is a good variety of characters with different weapons and abilites, so everyone can find something to their liking.   I can easily see this becoming one of my favourite games Ive ever played.  Its great fun with friends, although I do wish it had a duo mode.   10/10\", metadata={})]"
