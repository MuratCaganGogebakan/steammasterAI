Also, my tolerance level to guttural screams and loud sounds was increased.  Now I can bear the crying of my children for longer and I can make them feel better by singing sweet traditional songs from other cultures, such as   (Dark Eyes) or Garota de Ipanema (The Girl from Ipanema).  In conclusion, Counter Strike transformed me into a better father and a better person, in addition to making me more patient, tolerant to hateful people and more trained in languages and cultures.  Better than any psychiatric therapy. 10/10The time I spent playing this game could\\'ve been spent... ...studying ...applying for jobs ...making friends irl ...getting a wife ...spending time with my family ...working out ...becoming a better man in general  From the time I spent in this game, I got... ...an extremely racist and homophobic vocabulary ...free Russian lessons ...anger management issues ...borderline autistic tendencies ...sleep deprivation  10/10 would never uninstall this game and correct my life  P.S. PLEASE for the love of all that is holy, practice in Deathmatch and Casual as well as perfect your cross-hair and mouse sensitivity before you jump into competitive. People will thank you for it.Things I gave to Counter-Strike: 1. Money 2. Time 3. Love  Things Counter-Strike gave me: 1. Arthritis 2. Rage 3. Hatred of Russians, Spanish, and Russians 4.

       " '[b] Ubisoft, If you\\'re gonna bring your games back on steam at least bring them as a whole, not half-baked without steam cards or achievements, and the only reason I bought the game is because of the GOAT himself the CHICKEN MAN.[b] p.s [b]Thanks to EGS and UBS users for beta testing the game.[b]You can hunt wildlife with shovels You can throw them like spears You can swing them like a bat You can clear an entire outpost with only a shovel You can get a perk that allows you to carry, I am not kidding here, 9 shovels My shovels thrown per minute, (or STPM) is honestly insane There is also something about a cult and you need to save people, look the point is there is no better game that allows you to shovel your way to the end as good as what i have played so far.  10/10This is another Far Cry game. Just like the others. Minor things have changed but overall I\\'m having fun. Like ALL other Ubisoft titles, DO NOT BUY unless this is on sale. Ubisoft very quickly talked crap about Steam but as soon as their company is in trouble they come crawling back to the STABLE business that seems to do things above board instead of very publicly abusing their employees and forcing unnecessary DRM down our throats while re-releasing the same franchise almost yearly like an EA title. Ubisoft is disgusting.  I got this game for $15. That is the only price I would recommend this game at.I played for about 30 mins and had 4 crashes.  1. No response in the accessibility menu -> crash 2. Took screenshot -> crash 3. Took screenshot -> crash 4. Took screenshot -> crash  \"mAyBe yOu sHoUlDn\\'t tAkE ScReEnShOtS\" - Yeah, or maybe this junk software is $h1TTy optimized for Steam.',\n",
       " \"Feels and plays like the best Far Cry since the very original.   The way that Ubisoft has transformed the Far Cry formula is excellent. Most people talk about how similar this is to the past games but trust me, this game has added so much new stuff, such as horse riding, extra activities like supply drops and anti aircraft cannons, tons of materials used to craft attachments to your guns, unique guns that you can find within crates or ones you can buy with depleted uranium and perhaps my favorite addition, the supremo, and yet I'm barely scratching the surface! I love how they have incorporated the unique weapon rewards behind side missions, main missions and treasure hunts. Getting unique weapons as part of main mission concept has been there from before and getting them as rewards from side missions is amazing.  The villain is the best we have had so far, in my opinion, with the additional struggle of his son who wants peace, and so this creates a great twist on the father son dynamic. The way that they incorporated this new RPG system is really well done and the characters are entertaining, lovable and have very deep character moments.   Giancarlo Esposito performance really made this game come to life!   The graphics and visuals are fantastic.  There is a very nice audio book release on Audible that serves as a prequel to this game I highly recommend the listen, its voice by a full cast and makes a greet listen during a long ride or workout.   Overall, a great game.   P.S. Welcome back to Steam Ubisoft, but GIVE US ACHIEVEMENTS AND TRADING CARDS ITS NOT HARD!\",\n",
       " \"The game is alright, its a far cry with good settings and villain. BUT This steam release from ubisoft is a disaster. No achivements, no trading cards, the game crashing when i want to make a screenshot with steam and the worst is you're forced to download all of the dlcs with the base game.  Ubisoft is so desperate right now, they must release this on steam i got it. But this release is so sad and infuriating.\",\n",
       " 'Well..  Ok, Ill admit, unlike other high profile folk that have more hours then me.. I have just under 2000 hours but have been playing this game for well over 10 years.. To be exact March 8th 2009. (as my badge says)  I may be a no one in the community, but I have been supporting this game since I first played. The game I would always come back to and call \"home\".  I, over the years have made friends, enemies, servers.. Learnt different modes, meta, styles, languages.. I have been through multiple events like, The Sniper vs. Spy Update, Classless Update, the big 119th updates update (no joke..) Solider vs Demoman, Scream Fortresses, Christmas updates! You get the point..  There is no sparkle to this game anymore, I cannot jump on a 118 ping New York server, late at night waiting for the Americans to get back online in the evening, me and Banksy taking on 2Fort as Demoman to kill all soliders so that the Demoman could have his own weapon? (Spolier: Solider won, welcome to the Gunboats..) Then finding out TF2 came onto Mac and people that had it, got the ear buds, that sold well..   To be fair, I could go on and tell my war stories, but that feeling when the family gets a new puppy and you get shut out as no one is interested in you anymore? This is exactly whats happening with TF2 (dev side).. I always check steam stats and there is always over 50k people playing, always top 10 on the chart but something is missing..  As part of the community, us loyal people that cherish this game, we are the backbone to this beautiful creation. You don\\'t see Blizzard (well not all the time) not maintaining their beautiful creation and of course World of Warcraft is older then this.. Maybe because of the paid subscription, but I am sure that TF2 alone use to get more money as a free to play game at one point. (Jeeze I had to pay for TF2 over 10 years ago..)  I mean ok, fair play, you have a new game coming out.. whooptie doo.. Send all the cavalry towards that.. Yet instead to the ',\n",
       " 'people who grew up with TF2, old players and new players. People who have spent hundreds and even thousands of dollars for now a game which to me is dying.. Not the people\\'s fault, but your own selves.. Jumping into a casual game (YOUR servers) to be greeted by not one sniper but three sniper \"bots\" that have their own way-points, spamming \"good shot mate\", aim botting, auto spamming chat so no one can see whats written as a wall of blank appears and calling no when someone votes them a ban. When there is 3 or more of them they win the no vote anyway..  When making your own stuff glitch gets patched.. finding glitches in the items_game text file gets patched.. Oh yeah I forgot that\\'s your profits going down the drain.. But don\\'t worry as bots and hackers are not, so were forget about it.. the game.. the people, who truly love and support this game..  Excuse the rant but for a game that still, to me at this dire moment, is still rocking the steam charts, this should be dealt with within a matter of days or weeks.. There are no new updates like the Solider vs Demoman.. The love for this game from you, just has vanished..   I will carry on playing as I still love this game and class this as home. But for now, don\\'t expect me to dedicate my time or spend money on anything till this \"bot\" situation and other stupid stuff is dealt with.. and hopefully soon. With new updates that sparkle in my eyes.. And a new bloody weapon for the Demoman as I deemed the solider win was unfair.    Do I recommend it to others? Oh yes, yes I do. But at the moment with the bot situation, other stupid stuff and the game at the moment being \"devless\". No. But still download it, go onto the community servers, find a mode, map, server and enjoy. I will give it a thumbs up but really should be a thumbs down at this point of the games life.  **New Players** the first initiate is daunting, but play for fun, learn who the characters are and the history about them. I did and it got me 2000 hours, 10 ',\n",
       " 'years of play and a game I could call home. There are also comics about the game to if you like to read.  Good luck and thank you for the read.ive done it all played before mann co played casual  played comp played surf got my first unusual  got scammed for my unusual  wasted my life on most orange servers  spend 2000+ hours as sniper (always increasing) i dont think ive played heavy yet and ive probably been dropped around 1000 - 100000 crates :P  it never gets old  I even somehow got banned on etf2l for cheating LOLEven tho the game is abandoned by valve , it still has that weird magic in it , where you meet all shorts of people ... The tryhards that stomp casual pubs, the innocent newbies that have no idea whats happening, the really funny people that will interact with you , the friendlies that betray you or protect you , the salty/toxic people...It\\'s a very... unique experience playing this game.  As someone who used to play tf2 at its \"prime\" , It\\'s still the same game if you think about it (except all the bots n cheaters apocalypse thats going on) but overall , same good old tf2 that makes me laugh.  As an fps shooter game i\\'d say its very good , each class is unique enough by itself to make the game x10 intresting. And well , thats the reason I have 3k+ hours on it .  Just give the game a try its free , and really damn good .   Tryhards pls chill a bit .',\n",
       " 'Full disclosure: I\\'m not a racing guy. I\\'m not a car guy, even. My extent of car knowledge begins and ends at \"vroom-vroom go that way.\"  But that\\'s all you need to know for this game. I can tune the holy bejeezus out of a million sliders that mean absolutely nothing to me, or I can just equip a premade setting by someone who does and suddenly the vroom-vrooms are *better*. Not sure when to brake or start a turn? Easy, there\\'s a friendly line. Follow the line, make less vroom-vrooms when it\\'s red, everything\\'s gravy. Don\\'t have the reaction time to follow the line? You can slow the game down until it\\'s at a pace where you can. Incredible.  You can be as serious as you want with it. Me, I\\'m taking my van that\\'s dolled up to look like the Mystery Machine and ramping it off a volcano.Just weebs with 144p anime tiddies on their car pushing you off the road in online races. Then slamming into the wall, screaming spanish words into their Wish.com mic and quitting. Learned what a \"hijo de puta\" was within 2 minutes. 11/10 tbhForza Horizon 5 is a masterclass example of how to do an open-world racing game, bar none. Thanks to its deeply rich map, wealth of content, and fantastic visuals, it\\'s the best racing experience I\\'ve had yet.As far as racing games go, this one really takes the cake. While this game shirks on some aspects of Forza Horizon such as custom body kits; it delivers big with a beautiful world and focus on Baja. I\\'ve always thought of Forza as a better Gran Tourismo and this title is no different. If you are looking for the best racing game on PC, look no further.',\n",
       " \"It's basically Forza Horizon 4.5.  The map is new, the graphics are slightly better, most cars are carried over from previous games in the series, and gameplay modes are almost exactly the same as in Horizon 4. There are some quality of life improvements in the UI, some new multiplayer-centric activities, but overall it plays the same as the previous game. That itself is not a bad thing, as obviously the devs stick to the tried-and-tested formula that works. But this time it feels like they played it too safe. Who knows, maybe the DLC will introduce more new content and changes, while the devs focus until now was to get the base game done ready for the November release slot.   To sum up: - If you haven't played Horizon 4, buy that one on sale instead of 5. It looks almost as good, it's sold at a good discount, it has more content and less bugs, and the online community is still active.  -  if you liked Horizon 4 or you want to run with the cool kids and play the newest game, then I can recommend Horizon 5.  - if you didn't like previous Horizon games, there's nothing new here that will change your mind.The game looks amazing and is fun to play. The only issue is the potential burnout. If you aren't constantly getting new vehicles and pushing yourself to perform in multiplayer, you are going to run out of new things to do.\",\n",
       " \"I enjoyed CK2 but I have to admit, I never really knew what I was doing when I played it.   CK3 is much more accessible to me and I actually feel I know what I'm trying to accomplish and how to accomplish it. If that means the game has been dumbed down, well, I'm dumb enough to be OK with that.hile I consolidated my position.  In 1211 I received news of my father's death. After the messenger left my chambers, I went to the family shrine and knelt in prayer, vowing to my father's spirit that his son, my brother, would finally be avenged.  More years passed. As both kingdoms were now mine, I slowly amassed enough gold and troops to take on my entire realm. A careful campaign of pacification had made my vassals compliant.  It is the year 1218, and time to put my plan into action. I expose Duke Ugo's deviancy. He is now a criminal. As my father did twenty years before, I revoke his title, and again, he rises up in rebellion, but this time no one will stand with him. My troops outnumber his four to one. With laughable ease I storm his palace and win victory. My knights drag him out and throw him down in the mud before me.  I arrest him and throw him in the dungeon. I revoke all of his titles and grant them to a distant toddler cousin. Years of emotional stress are wiped away in an instant--Ugo, my rival, murderer of my brother is now mine to do with as I will. Shall I torture him? Execute him? Shall I simply leave him there to rot in filth and misery? I ponder this choice, and the sweetness of vengeance.\"]"
